    "# Training a model on forces and energies\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the energy, machine learning models can also be used to model response properties such as forces.\n",
    "These are $N_\\mathrm{atoms} \\times 3$ arrays describing the Cartesian force acting on each atom due to the overall (potential) energy.\n",
    "They are formally defined as the negative gradient of the energy $E_\\mathrm{pot}$ with respect to the nuclear positions $\\mathbf{R}$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{F}^{(\\alpha)} = -\\frac{\\partial E_\\mathrm{pot}}{\\partial \\mathbf{R}^{(\\alpha)}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the index of the nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above expression offers a straightforward way to include forces in machine learning models by simply defining a model for the energy and taking the appropriate derivatives. \n",
    "The resulting model can directly be trained on energies and forces.\n",
    "Moreover, in this manner energy conservation and the correct behaviour under rotations of the molecule is guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using forces in addition to energies to construct a machine learning model offers several advantages.\n",
    "Accurate force predictions are important for molecular dynamics simulations, which will be covered in the subsequent tutorial.\n",
    "Forces also encode a greater wealth of information than the energies. \n",
    "For every molecule, only one energy is present, while there are $3N_\\mathrm{atoms}$ force entries.\n",
    "This property, combined with the fact that reference forces can be computed at the same cost as energies, makes models trained on forces and energies very data efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will show how to train such force models and how to use them in practical applications."
